** This is a framework for multiplayer with Steam, IPs, and local options.

* Using this requires the GodotSteam MP build found [here](https://github.com/GodotSteam/GodotSteam/releases)
* Make sure to grab the MultiplayerPeer option (It's a separate release)

More detailed instructions coming soon!
